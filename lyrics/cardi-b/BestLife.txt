I'm living my best life, yeah, yeah
I'm living my best life
Made a couple M's, you know (ah, huh)
Said I'm living my best life, said I'm living my best life
Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pulling up, it's like skrrt
Dreams filling up, I'm like skrrt
I'm living my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
I'm like big pop mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Machiavelli (yeah)
You need some Little Caesar's pizza, I be Hot & Ready (woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom & Jerry
Nigga, you ain't balling, you just talking, that's that commentary (huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this"
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the tank, yeah, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
"Cardi B is so problematic" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talking junk and just think these hoes mad trash
I'm giggling won't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefing, I'm just keeping to myself
I'm my own competition, I'm competing with myself (brrrp)
I told y'all, I said I'm living my best life (woo)
I told y'all, I said I'm living my best life (ayy)
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons (skrrt, skrrt)
You see the whip pulling up, it's like skrrt (like skrrt)
Dreams filling up, I'm like skrrt (like skrrt)
I'm living my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like (Chance, The Rapper)
You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winning, I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women
When you tricking, send it fly
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trapping and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she having shit you had to try whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life
In that guava like Iyanla 'cause that bag just is my life
Hey, y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne
But can we please get some more champagne?
Police, no Andre, G like 'Venchy
Reach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yoncé
'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii
Now they hold cash, won't peak like Dante
I told y'all, I said I'm living my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm living my best life (ayy)
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pulling up, it's like skrrt (skrrt, skrrt, like skrrt)
Dreams filling up, I'm like skrrt (like skrrt)
I'm living my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
I said I never had a problem showing y'all the real me
Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch stories, stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all got a bed with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walking red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes that I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls
I'm like gold, I'm like goals, man, I chose and I'm floating, ayy
I told y'all, I said I'm living my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm living my best life (ayy)
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons (hey, hey, hey, hey)
You see the whip pulling up, it's like skrrt (like skrrt)
Dreams filling up, I'm like skrrt (like skrrt)
I'm living my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
Skrrt skrrt, going down right now
Skrrt skrrt, Jamie Foxx in your town, like
Skrrt skrrt, money piling up, man
All the blessings coming down
You don't know 'bout nothing, you don't know 'bout nothing
You don't know 'bout nothing, you don't know 'bout nothing
I told y'all, I told y'all (You don't know 'bout nothing)
I t-, I told y'all, I told y'all (You don't know 'bout nothing)
Told y'all, I t-, I told y'all (You don't know 'bout nothing)
You don't know (You don't know 'bout nothing)
