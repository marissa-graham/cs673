They gave a bitch two options: stripping or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get in Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm dripping in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news
I started speaking my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're motherfucking right
Never been no fraud in my motherfucking life
Get money, go hard, damn fucking right
Stunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite
Ain't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory
I ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just trying to chill and make bangers"
Tell all these old bitches they in danger
The thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape
That's what I call a fucking waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what?
I think ya got your story screwed up
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough
I'm the one who's killing shit, hands down
If you got a problem with me, say it now
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissing
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on the go like I don't see no stop lights
I'm stepping out every day, prom night
So if it's all love, show me love then
'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up
Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun
And we all know you ain't that tight
I smack you and the bitch that you act like
I started getting money, bitches upset
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced
Come through shinning with them Rollies bust face
Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches feeling like this since 08'
I don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch
Whole life been through some fucked up shit
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this
I walked into the label, "where the check at?"
Cardi B on the charts, you can expect that
Where that bitch that was claiming she a threat?
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild
I'm Chyna wit' the porn like a bad ass child
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (Blap!)
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Bitch
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy
We gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Yeah
I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times, but I get up ten
Bitch
