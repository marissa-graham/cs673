Ayo, step up in the spot, they know who I be
Couple bottles pop in the VIP
Dancing all up on the couch, shaking my ass
Probably leave with ya man, grand larceny
Bitch, pardon me
You don't wanna start with me
I be out here getting cash, you be in the thottery
I be in the trap, chasing chips like the lottery
You ain't bout that life
You don't be like Cardi B
All my getting-shmoney hoes, put ya hands up
Yeah, you cute but you gon have to pull ya pants up
I see you over there checking out my thick thighs
So I gotta smart mouth and what?
I go litty for my city, NYC
Take the whole nut, ain't worried bout no Plan B
Yeah, I'm nasty
Lick my lips, blow a kiss and walk off with a hunnid thou on my wrist
Swish, I ain't with the politics
"A hoe never gets cold", you know what the motto is
Unless it's forgets diamond cuts, gold bottles, bitch
Sitting in that 64, bitch, feeling hella lit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slaying shit, I'm in the best fit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slaying shit, I'm in the best fit
NY, do or die, yeah I got this
KSR, chill y'all, yeah I got this
40 those, 2 seater in the cockpit
And I'm a freak so you know that bitch topless
You a hot mess, that's a fact tho
Understood the life, bitch, you know how that go
A lot of thots out here crowding up my cash flow
But I'm a queen just tryna build a castle
You a fiend, you all up in my asshole
I cause a scene and give you what you ask for
Hair did, manicure, so ready
Check
Attitude have to be so petty, yep
I made it this year, I made it to here, I swear
My vision is clear, y'all bitches be weird, I'm here
Showstopper, Ms. Life of the party, yeah
Top shotter, no filter, Young Cardi
Yeah
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slaying shit, I'm in the best fit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slaying shit, I'm in the best fit
