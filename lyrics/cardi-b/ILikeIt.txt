Yeah baby
I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
Now I like dollars, I like diamond
I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals
Where's my pen, bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas
The ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler
I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes
When they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong
I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi
Banging body, spicy mommy
Hot tamale, hotter than a sauce
Molly, Purr, Coco, Garry
Hop out the stu, jump in the coupe
They trippin' on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry, though
Bout my coins like Mario
Yeah they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio
Oh, damn
Diamonds, just forget the chains
I said I like it like that
Instead of fighting, call game, game, game, game
I said I like it like that
Drop the top and blow the brains
I said I like it like that
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name?
I said I like it like that
Oh I need the dollars
I said I like it like that
Beat it up like piñatas
I said I like it like that
Tell the driver, close the curtains
I said I like it like that
Bad bitch make him nervous
I said I like it like that
Cardi B
Chambean, chambean, pero no jalan (jalan)
Tú compras toa' las Jordan, bobo, a mí me las regalan
I spend in the club, while you hop on in the bank
This is the new religion, bang, en latino gang (gang)
Trato de hacer dieta, pero esque en el closet tengo mucha grasa
Ya mude la Gucci pa' adentro de casa, yea
Cabron a ti no te conocen ni en plaza
El diablo me llama pero Jesucristo me abraza
Guerrero como Eddie, que viva la raza (yuh)
Me gustan boricuas, me gustan cubanas
Me gusta el acento de la colombiana
Como mueve el culo la dominicana
Lo rico que me chingan las venezolanas
Andamos activos, Perico Pin Pin
Billetes de cien en el maletín
Que retumbe el bajo Bobby Valentin, yeah
Aquí prohibido amar, dile Charytín
Que pal' 
 le tengo Claritin
Yo llego a la disco y se forma el motín
Diamonds, just forget the chains
Pa, pa, pa, pa
I said I like it like that
Instead of fighting, call game, game, game, game
I said I like it like that
Drop the top and blow the brains
I said I like it like that
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name?
I said I like it like that
Oh I need the dollars
I said I like it like that
Beat it up like piñatas
I said I like it like that
Tell the driver, close the curtains
I said I like it like that
Bad bitch make him nervous
I said I like it like that
Como Celia Cruz tengo el azucar
Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy 
Te vamos a tumbar la peluca
Y arranca al carajo cabrón que a ti no te va' pasar la hookah
Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada
Pa-pa-pa-pa-razzi, like I'm Lady Gaga
Y no te me hagas, que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara
No salgo de tu mente
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado mi gente
Yo no soy high, soy como el Testarossa (Testarossa)
Yo soy el que la vive y también el quien la goza (goza, goza, goza)
En la cosa, mami en la cosa (cosa, cosa)
El quien mira sufre y el que toca goza (goza, goza)
I said I like it like that
(I said I like it like that)
I said I like it like that
(I said I like it like that)
Diamonds, just forget the chains
I said I like it like that
Instead of fighting, call game, game, game, game
I said I like it like that
Drop the top and blow the brains
I said I like it like that
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name?
I said I like it
