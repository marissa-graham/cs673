Now what about your career as an artist
And what was your inspiration
Well you know I've been writing rhymes and I've been into music ever since I was in high school. But you know when you young you have these dreams of becoming this big star or being an artist. But your dreams start getting crushed by priorities and bills you know. After I got kicked out of my house when I was 18, its like I didn't have 200 dollars to invest in a studio session like I had to pay bills I had to pay my rent. Now that I'm making that shmoney, its like, why not invest on my dreams that I always dreamt of. You know what I'm saying. You got to follow your dreams, like fuck you mean
