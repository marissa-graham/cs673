Yeah
Looking like I caught a (Look at me)
Cardi (Look at me)
Cardi (Look at me)
Woah
Looking like I caught a lick
Run up on me you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx New York, gangsta bitch
Looking like I caught a lick
Since the run, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Looking like I caught a lick
Looking like I caught a lick
Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before now they booking me
The glow that bitches so shook at me
They like, "Shit, Cardi B what you cooking bih?"
I say, "Bitches, got me on some new shit"
I swear niggas got me feeling ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walking in the stores, I couldn't buy nothing
They look at me staring
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, "Gimme my money!
Why the fuck you asking all this info?"
Run up get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grinding all night
Didn't sleep till the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit
Looking like I caught a lick
Run up on me you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx New York, gangsta bitch
Looking like I caught a lick
Since the run, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Looking like I caught a lick
Looking like I caught a lick
See me in my 'bach
Now they all surprised
Now they call my phone
I just press decline
Not even six seconds
I don't give 'em Vine
Tell 'em, "Fall back"
All must recline
Bitches mad as fuck
But I don't give a fuck
Niggas can't believe it
Better soak it up
Looking like I caught a lick, bitch
Your nigga got me on his wishlist
Thought I was making no move?
Thought I was gon' be living in Sues?
Thought I was making no money?
You fucking thought I was gon' lose
Everything now that I swear I got pay
Been 'bout my money, that ain't gon' change
Bitch you gon' drown tryna ride on my wave
Corny ass bitches, I just can't relate
Run up get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grinding all night
Didn't sleep till the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit
Looking like I caught a lick
Run up on me you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx New York, gangsta bitch
Looking like I caught a lick
Since the run, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Looking like I caught a lick
Looking like I caught a lick
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
