Motherfuckers be like "but what type of niggas will wife you?"
My type of niggas will wife me! The type of niggas that like bitches that pop off and suck dick all day motherfucking long bitch
Thanks to all my followers that always defended me, y'all my God brothers and God sisters, I would dare jump in your fight, I would dare jump in your fight. Now what's poppin?
Who wanna pop off
Who wanna start war
They talkin' shit?
I'm taking tops off
Jeans, pause
Weaves, pause
Rings, pause
Everything, off

I'm starting to lose my patience
Weak bitches hating
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy
I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
"Cardi why you feisty?"
Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me?
Your nigga wanna wife me
You think cause I'm a stripper hoe that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face
Ride that shit nicely
Tear his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do
You and you and you
I feel some type a way
A bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal
I'm bout to 
 the hill
The wig is coming off
Shit bout to get real
Who wanna pop off
Who wanna start war
They talkin' shit?
I'm taking tops off
Jeans, pause
Weaves, pause
Rings, pause
Everything, off

Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'm a drop it off
Oh you shining? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was getting you pussy, not at all
You was getting lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starving
I gotta feed all 'em
I'm gon' get that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
They thought switched cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine
You got a problem get in line
It's Cardi B, and 2 times

Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder something retarded
I ain't backing down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You want her to knock me out, and you think I'm a forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple nigga and they had you out when the call went
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feeling now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor praying, like "sorry for your, loss"
Throw dirt on my, name, you better pop, off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box, off
I'm Cardi B, east coast contender
5'3" looking good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches I cut their lights, off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops off
