I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing, what am I doing?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over. It's far from over
Alright, bottles on me
'Long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck y'all thinking?
Making sure the young money ship is never sinking
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke a package of the Swishers
I did it overnight. It couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them, but fuck it me either
But point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ah
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing, what am I doing?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over. It's far from over
Uh,
One thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me.
I know better than that it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that. I'm just saying
I really can't complain. Everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture
Turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'mma quit before I die dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend
Am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it. Who you kidding, man?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it
Ah
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing, what am I doing?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over. It's far from over
