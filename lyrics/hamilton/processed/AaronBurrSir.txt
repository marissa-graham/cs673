1776
New York City
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir?
That depends, who's asking?
Oh well sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton
I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you
I'm getting nervous
Sir, I heard your name at Princeton
I was seeking an accelerated course of study
When I got sort out of sorts with a buddy of yours
I may have punched him
It’s a blur, sir
He handles the financials—
You punched the bursar?
Yes, I wanted to do what you did
Graduate in two, then join the revolution
He looked at me like I was stupid
I’m not stupid
So how’d you do it?
How’d you graduate so fast?
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed
You're an orphan
Of course, I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for
Can I buy you a drink?
That would be nice
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less
What?
Smile more
Ha
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for
You can't be serious
You want to get ahead?
Yes
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?
Showtime!
...like I said...
Showtime! Showtime! Yo!
I’m John Laurens in the place to be!
Uh, two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm working on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me
Cause I will pop chick-a-pop these cops 'til I'm free!
Ah oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the king, “Casse-toi!” Who's the best? C’est moi!
Brrrah, brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin’ it
Yes I heard your mother say “come again?”
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Lock up your daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets
Wow
No more sex
Pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more
To the revolution!
Well if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton College
Aaron Burr
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge
Good luck with that
You’re takin’ a stand
You spit, I’mma sit
We’ll see where we land
Booooo/Ohhhhhh
Burr, the revolution’s imminent
What do you stall for?
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?
Oooh
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?
