The Election of 1800!
Can we get back to politics?
Please?
Yo…
Every action has its equal opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed; I love the guy, but he’s in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I’m facing Aaron Burr with his own faction
He’s very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances
Ask him a question, it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances
And they say I’m a Francophile, at least they know I know where France is
Thomas, that’s the problem; see, they see Burr as a less extreme you
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you
Who did you have in mind?
Don’t laugh
Who is it?
You used to work on the same staff.
Whaaaat?
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
Talk less! (Burr!)
Smile more! (Burr!)
Don\'t let them know what you\'re against or what you\'re for! (Burr!)
Shake hands with him! (Burr!)
Charm her! (Burr!)
It’s 1800; ladies, tell your husbands, vote for Burr!
I don’t like Adams! Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist.
And Jefferson? In love with France! Yeah, he’s so elitist!
I like that Aaron Burr! I can’t believe we’re here with him!
He seems approachable? Like you could grab a beer with him
Dear Mr. Hamilton
Your fellow Federalists would like to know how you’ll be voting
(It’s quiet uptown…)
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who you are you promoting?
(It’s quiet uptown…)
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
We know, it’s lose/lose
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
But if you had to choose…
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who you are you promoting?
But if you had to choose!
Well, if isn’t Aaron Burr, sir.
Alexander!
You’ve created quite a stir, sir.
I’m going door to door!
You’re openly campaigning?
Sure!
That’s new.
Honestly, it’s kind of draining
Burr?
Sir?
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?
No, I’m chasing what I want, and you know what?
What?
I learned that from you
(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)
…It’s a tie
(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)
It’s up to the delegates
(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)
It’s up to Hamilton!
(If you had to choose, if you had to choose…)
(Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?)
(Choose, choose, choose!)
Yo
(Oh!) The people are asking to hear my voice
(Oh!) But the country is facing a difficult choice
(Oh!) And you were to ask me who I’d promote…
(Oh!) …Jefferson has my vote
(Oh!) I have never agreed with Jefferson once…
(Oh!) We have fought on like 75 different fronts
(Oh!) But when all said and all is done…
Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none
(Ooooh!)
Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!
Hamilton’s on your side
(Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!)
And… you won in a landslide
Congrats on a race well won
I did give you a fight.
Uh-huh…
I look forward to our partnership.
Our partnership?
As your vice president!
You hear this guy?
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be vice president
Why?
‘Cause I’m the president!
Burr…
When you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement.
