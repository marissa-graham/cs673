Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury, and I present 
"Free thoughts on the proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interest at heart
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don’t let them lead you astray
This congress does not speak for me
They’re playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame!
Heed not the rabble who
He'd have you all unravel at the sound of screams
Scream—
But the revolution
Revolution—
Is comin'
They have not your interests
The have-nots are gonna win this
At heart—
It’s hard to listen to you with a straight face
Chaos and—
Chaos and bloodshed
Bloodshed are not—
Already haunt us
A solution—
Honestly, you shouldn’t even talk—
Don’t let them lead you astray—
And what about Boston?
Look at the cost and all that we’ve lost
And you talk about Congress?
This Congress does not speak for me
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee
You’re playing a dangerous game
But strangely, your mange is the same!
I pray the king shows you his mercy
If you repeat yourself again I’m gonna
Scream—
Honestly, look at me, please don’t read!
Don’t modulate the key then not debate with me (laughter)
Why should a tiny island across the sea
Regulate the price of tea?
Burr, I’d rather be divisive than indecisive
Drop the niceties
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!
A message from the King!
