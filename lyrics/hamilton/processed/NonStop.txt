After the war I went back to New York
A-After the war I went back to New York
I finished up my studies and I practiced law
I practiced law, Burr worked next door
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Non-stop!                                           Non-stop! 
 
Gentlemen of the jury, I’m curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we’re making hist’ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind
.                                                       Non-stop! 
 
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That’s all you had to say!
Okay!
One more thing—
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!
Awwww!
Why do you write like you’re                Why do you write like you’re
running out of time?                            running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re
running out of time?      
Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re              Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re
running out of time                            running out of time
Keep on fighting. In the meantime—     
.                                                        Non-stop!
 
Corruption’s such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony’s economy’s increasingly stalling and
Seems to be calling me.                          He’s just     
.                                                          Non-stop!
 
I practiced the law, I practic’ly perfected it
I’ve seen injustice in the world and I’ve corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I’ll be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks
.                                                            Awww!
 
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention
There as a New York junior delegate:
Now what I’m going to say may sound indelicate…
Awwww!
Goes and proposes his own form of government!
What?
His own plan for a new form of government!      
 
What?
 
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!
Bright young man…
Yo, who the f is this?
Why do you always say what                               Why do you always say what
you believe?                                                      you believe?
Ev’ry proclamation guarantees free 
ammunition for your enemies!
.                                                                       Awww!
Going out of style?                                             Going out of style, hey!
Write day and night like it’s
Going out of style?                                             Going out of style, hey!     
 
Ev’ry day you fight like it’s
Going out of style
Do what you do
Alexander?
Aaron Burr, sir
It’s the middle of the night
Can we confer, sir?
Is this a legal matter?
Yes, and it’s important to me
What do you need?
Burr, you’re a better lawyer than me
Okay
I know I talk too much, I’m abrasive
You’re incredible in court. You’re succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You’re the solution
Who’s your client?
No
Hear me out
No way!
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public
No one will read it
I disagree
And if it fails?
Burr, that’s why we need it
The constitution’s a mess
So it needs amendments
It’s full of contradictions
So is independence
We have to start somewhere
No. No way
You’re making a mistake
Good night
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?
What?
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?
Of course
Then defend it
And what if you’re backing the wrong horse?
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don’t understand how you stand to the side
I’ll keep all my plans
.                                                     Wait for it, wait for
.                                                     It, wait…
I’ll wait here and see
Which way the wind                          Which way the wind
Will blow                                          Will blow
I’m taking my time                             I’m taking my time
Watching the                                    Watching the  
Afterbirth of a nation                          Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.                Watching the tension grow.
 
I am sailing off to London. I’m accompanied by someone
Who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will keep
Me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there’s no one who
Can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander
Angelica
Don’t forget to write
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series 
of essays defending the new United States Constitution, 
entitled The Federalist Papers. 
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, 
the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, 
they wrote eighty-five essays, 
in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. 
James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!
Running out of time?                              Running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re
Running out of time?                              Running out of time?
Ev’ry day you fight
Like you’re
Running out of time                                Running out of time?
Like you’re
Running out of time                                Running out of time?
Are you
Running out of time?                                Awwww!
 
How do you write like tomorrow won’t arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev’ry second you’re alive?
Ev’ry second you’re alive? Ev’ry second you’re alive?
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I’m asking you to be my right hand man
Treasury or State?
I know it’s a lot to ask
Treasury or State?
To leave behind the world you know…
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?
Treasury
Let’s go
Alexander…
I have to leave
Alexander—
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now
Helpless…
They are asking me to lead
Look around, isn’t this enough?
