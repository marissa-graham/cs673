How does Hamilton,
The short-tempered, protean creator
Of the coast guard,
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cabinet post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adam’s Admistration.
Jefferson’s the runner-up
Which makes him the vice-president,
Washington can’t help you now,
No more Mr. nice President
Adams fires Hamilton,
Privately calls him creole bastard in his taunts
Hamilton publishes his response.
Sit down John,
You fat mother-fucker.
Hamilton’s out of control,
This is great:
He’s out of power,
He holds no office
And he just destroyed president John Adams
The only other significant member of his party
Hamilton is a host unto himself,
As long as he can hold a pen,
He’s a threat.
Let’s let him know what we know.
