There’s nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slumming it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk at the students in the common
Just to watch ‘em talk
Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at
The Schuyler sisters
But—look around, look around
The revolution’s happening in New York
Eliza, I’m looking for a mind at work (work, work)
Woa-oah
Ooh, there’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it’s not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy’s got money
Why you slummin’ in the city in your fancy heels?
You searchin’ for an urchin who can give you ideals?
Ahh, so you’ve discussed me
I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me
I’ve been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I’m intense or I’m insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson (unh!)
I’mma compel him to include women in the sequel
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now
History is happening in Manhattan and we
Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world
Cause I’ve been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
(look around, look around)((hey, hey, hey, hey))
So men say that I’m intense or I’m insane
(the revolution’s happening in)((hey, hey, hey, hey))
(New York) You want a revolution? ((look around, look around))
I want a revelation (In New York, woah)
So listen to my declaration ((the revolution's happening))
We hold these truths to be self evident
(look around, look around) (hey, hey)
That all men are created equal
(at how lucky we are to be alive right now) (hey, hey)
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
History is happening in Manhattan
And we just happen to be
We’re looking for a mind at work (work, work)
Hey (work, work)
Woah-ah! (work, work)
Hey (work, work)
In the greatest city
In the greatest city
In the world!
