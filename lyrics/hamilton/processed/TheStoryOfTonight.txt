I may not live to see our glory
I may not live to see our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell our story
And when our children tell our story
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Let’s have another round tonight
Let’s have another round tonight
Let’s have another round tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there’ll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Let’s have another round tonight
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there’ll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
Let’s have another round tonight
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They’ll tell the story of tonight
They’ll tell the story of
Tonight
