I may not live to see our glory!
I may not live to see our glory!
But I've seen wonders great and small.
I've seen wonders great and small.
Cuz if the tomcat can get married,
If Alexander can get married-
There's hope for our ass, after all!
Raise a glass to freedom.
Hey!
Something you will never see again!
No matter what she tells you.
Let's have another round tonight!
Raise a glass to the four of us!
Ho!
To the newly not poor of us!
Woo!
We'll tell the story of tonight.
Let's have another round-
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr.
Sir!
I didn't think you would make it.
To be sure.
Burr!
I came to say congratulations.
Spit a verse, Burr!
I see the whole gang is here.
You are the worst, Burr!
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel.
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
Now, be sensible.
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable.
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr.
Is that so?
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?
I should go.
No, these guys should go.
What?
No!
Leave us alone.
Man...
It's alright, Burr.
I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr.
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir.
What do you mean?
She's married.
I see.
She's married to a British officer.
Oh shit...
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more.
I'll see you on the other side of the war.
I will never understand you.
If you love this woman, go get her!
What are you waiting for?
I'll see you on the other side of the war.
I'll see you on the other side of the war.
