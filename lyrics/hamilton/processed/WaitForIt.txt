Theodosia writes me a letter ev'ry day.
I'm keeping her bed warm while her husband is away.
He's on the British side of Georgia.
He's tryin' to keep the colonies in line.
He can keep all of Georgia.
Theodosia, she's mine.
Love doesn't discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway.
We laugh and we cry
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
when so many have tried
then I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher,

But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya.
Teach ya

My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect.
Respect
Respect
When they died they left no instructions.
Just a legacy to protect.
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep living anyway.
We rise and we fall
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
when everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.
Wait for it.
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I am the one thing in life I can control
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I am inimitable
I am an original
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I'm not falling behind or running late
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I'm not standing still,
I am lying in wait
Wait
Wait

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
Climb
Climb
Climb
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose
Hamilton's pace is relentless
he wastes no time
Time
Time
Time
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate.
He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes
and he keeps winning anyway.
He changes the game.
He plays and he raises the stakes.
And if there's a reason
he seems to thrive when so few survive,
then God dammit
I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it...
Life doesn't discriminate
between the sinners and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes
We rise.
We fall
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many others have died,
then I'm willin' to-
I'm willing to wait for it.
Wait for it
Wait for...
I'm willing to-
Life doesn't discriminate
between the sinners and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes

we rise and we fall and we break
and we make our mistakes
and if there's a reason
I'm still alive
when so many have died,
then I'm willing' to-
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...

Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
