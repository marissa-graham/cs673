Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?
President Jefferson:
I’ll give him this: his financial system is a
Work of genius. I couldn’t undo it if I tried
And I tried
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?
President Madison:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?
Every other founding father story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old
But when you’re gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?
.                                                            Who tells your story?
Who tells your story?                                Your story?
Eliza
I put myself back in the narrative
Eliza
I stop wasting time on tears
I live another fifty years
It’s not enough
Eliza
I interview every soldier who fought by your side
She tells our story
I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you’re running out of
Time
I rely on—
Angelica
While she’s alive—
We tell your story
She is buried in Trinity Church
Near you
When I needed her most, she was right on
Time
And I’m still not through
I ask myself, “What would you do if you had more”
Time
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more—
Time
She tells my story
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had—
Time
And when my time is up, have I done enough?
Will they tell our story?                             Will they tell your story?
 
Oh. Can I show you what I’m proudest of?
The orphanage
I established the first private orphanage in New York City
The orphanage
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up
The orphanage
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every—
Time
And when my time is up
Will they tell my story?                              Will they tell your story?
 
Oh, I can’t wait to see you again
It’s only a matter of—
Time
.                                                             Time…
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
.                                                             Time…
Will they tell your story?
.                                                              Time…
Who lives, who dies—      
Who tells your story?
