Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premiere!)
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'
Ay, I got somethin'
Hold up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I'm with it
Only for the night, I'm kiddin'
Only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over mean
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, our money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me
I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Damn it, we jammin'
Bad attitude from your nanny
Curves and your hips from your mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yep
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me
