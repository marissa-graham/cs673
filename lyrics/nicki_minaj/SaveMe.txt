I drove for miles
Just to find
You and find myself
All these screams
All these voices
In my head
You gave me strength
Gave me hope
For a lifetime
I never was satisfied
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up 
It's not your fault
I'm a bitch
I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast
And I feast
When I conquer
But I'm alone
On my throne
All these riches
I came this way
All this way
Just to say hey
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up 
I'm givin up baby
I'm givin up baby
(feels like I've been driven for miles)
I'm givin up baby
(and I can't seem to silence these voices in my head)
This time won't you save me
(please save me)
This time won't you save me
(please save me)
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin up
Givin up
